# Trie-Data-Structure-Project
A lab project implementing a Trie data structure using [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/?er=221886).
<br>
Course: ICS 202 - Data Structures and Algorithms

## Getting Started
No dependencies required, simply run with the **dictionary.txt** file included


## Features & Procedure
- Trie data structure: Permits efficient lookup of words in a dictionary
- Creating a new empty trie or inintal trie
- Inserting a word
- Searching for a word
- Delete word
- Search words with a prefix
- Calculate size of trie
- Program will then make all arrangements of the letters in this word and insert them in the trie if these are valid words from the dictionary
